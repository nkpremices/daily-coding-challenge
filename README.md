# daily-coding-challenge 👨🏿‍💻

I try to solve a standard technical interview question everyday. Sometimes I succeed sometimes I fail. This is a collection of those attempts using a mixture of languages, mostly python.

## How to Use

Each folder has a README that contains the question and a sort of implementation of my solution. I have separated each challenge into a separate directory. Disclaimer: My solution is by no means the best possible solution to these problems, and I take no credit for the problems either.

This was inspired from @iyikuyoro
